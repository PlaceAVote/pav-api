## Running

There are two ways to start the application.  

The first is to having your own instances of Neo4J and Redis running.  This is ok if your machine has a decent spec.
If you wish to install both of these then consult the following references [Redis][4], [Neo4J][5]

If both redis and neo4j are installed locally, you can start the web server by issuing the following command:

[4]:http://redis.io/topics/quickstart
[5]:http://neo4j.com/download/

    Lein ring server

The second and preferred way to launch the application locally is with the use of convox.
Convox will read the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files and start the server with the correct setup.  Just issue
the following command once docker and Convox are installed.

    convox start
