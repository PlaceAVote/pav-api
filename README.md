## Running

There are two ways to start the application.  

#### Method 1
The first is to having your own instances mysql running, you can start the web server by issuing the following command:

    Lein ring server
    
This will run a flyway migration script and create the tables in a schema called pav_user.  Please ensure this schema exists
first.  If you want to use a different user other than root then update the project.clj file.


#### Method 2
The second and preferred way to launch the application locally is with the use of convox.
Convox will read the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files and start the server with the correct setup.  Just issue
the following command once docker and Convox are installed.  This will point to a database hosted in AWS.  If you want to use a local
database instead then see method 1.

    convox start
